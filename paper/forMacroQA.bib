	abstract = {Human {MRI} scanners at ultra-high magnetic field strengths of 7 T and higher are increasingly available to the neuroscience community. A key advantage brought by ultra-high field {MRI} is the possibility to increase the spatial resolution at which data is acquired, with little reduction in image quality. This opens a new set of opportunities for neuroscience, allowing investigators to map the human cortex at an unprecedented level of detail. In this review, we present recent work that capitalizes on the increased signal-to-noise ratio available at ultra-high field and discuss the theoretical advances with a focus on sensory and motor systems neuroscience. Further, we review research performed at sub-millimeter spatial resolution and discuss the limits and the potential of ultra-high field imaging for structural and functional imaging in human cortex. The increased spatial resolution achievable at ultra-high field has the potential to unveil the fundamental computations performed within a given cortical area, ultimately allowing the visualization of the mesoscopic organization of human cortex at the functional and structural level.},

	abstract = {Quantitative {MRI} provides biophysical measures of the microstructural integrity of the {CNS}, which can be compared across {CNS} regions, patients, and centres. In patients with multiple sclerosis, quantitative {MRI} techniques such as relaxometry, myelin imaging, magnetization transfer, diffusion {MRI}, quantitative susceptibility mapping, and perfusion {MRI}, complement conventional {MRI} techniques by providing insight into disease mechanisms. These include: (i) presence and extent of diffuse damage in {CNS} tissue outside lesions (normal-appearing tissue); (ii) heterogeneity of damage and repair in focal lesions; and (iii) specific damage to {CNS} tissue components. This review summarizes recent technical advances in quantitative {MRI}, existing pathological validation of quantitative {MRI} techniques, and emerging applications of quantitative {MRI} to patients with multiple sclerosis in both research and clinical settings. The current level of clinical maturity of each quantitative {MRI} technique, especially regarding its integration into clinical routine, is discussed. We aim to provide a better understanding of how quantitative {MRI} may help clinical practice by improving stratification of patients with multiple sclerosis, and assessment of disease progression, and evaluation of treatment response., Quantitative {MRI} techniques provide biophysical measures of the microstructural integrity of the {CNS}.

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
          {MRI} has a crucial position in the diagnostic routine of epilepsy patients. It relevantly contributes to etiological diagnostics and is indispensable in presurgical evaluation. As modern {MRI} research has been a boon to clinical neuroscience in general, it also holds the promise of enhancing diagnostics of epilepsy patients; i.e. increasing the diagnostic yield while decreasing the number of {MRI}-negative patients. Its rapid progress, however, has caused uncertainty about which of its latest developments already are of clinical interest and which still are of academic interest. It is the purpose of this review to clarify what, to the authors’ mind, good practice of {MRI} in epilepsy patient care is today and what it might be tomorrow.
          Recent findings 
          Progress of diagnostic {MRI} in epilepsy patients is driven by development of scanner hardware, scanner sequence and data postprocessing. Ultra high-field {MRI} and elaborate sequences provide datasets of novel quality which can be fed into postprocessing programs extracting pathognomonic features of structural or functional anatomy. The integration of these features by means of computerized classifiers yield previously unsurpassed diagnostic validity. Enthusiasm about Diffusion Tensor Imaging and functional {MRI} in the evaluation before epilepsy surgery is quelled.
          Summary 
          The application of an epilepsy tailored {MRI} protocol at 3 Tesla followed by meticulous expert evaluation early after the onset of epilepsy is most crucial. It is hoped that future research will result in {MRI} workups more standardized than today and widely used postprocessing routines analyzing co-registered three-dimensional volumes from different modalities.},

	abstract = {Cerebrovascular imaging is of great interest in the understanding of neurological disease. {MRI} is a non-invasive technology that can visualize and provide information on: (i) the structure of major blood vessels; (ii) the blood flow velocity in these vessels; and (iii) the microcirculation, including the assessment of brain perfusion. Although other medical imaging modalities can also interrogate the cerebrovascular system, {MR} provides a comprehensive assessment, as it can acquire many different structural and functional image contrasts whilst maintaining a high level of patient comfort and acceptance. The extent of examination is limited only by the practicalities of patient tolerance or clinical scheduling limitations. Currently, {MRI} methods can provide a range of metrics related to the cerebral vasculature, including: (i) major vessel anatomy via time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced imaging; (ii) blood flow velocity via phase contrast imaging; (iii) major vessel anatomy and tissue perfusion via arterial spin labeling and dynamic bolus passage approaches; and (iv) venography via susceptibility-based imaging. When designing an {MRI} protocol for patients with suspected cerebral vascular abnormalities, it is appropriate to have a complete understanding of when to use each of the available techniques in the ‘{MR} angiography toolkit’. In this review article, we: (i) overview the relevant anatomy, common pathologies and alternative imaging modalities; (ii) describe the physical principles and implementations of the above listed methods; (iii) provide guidance on the selection of acquisition parameters; and (iv) describe the existing and potential applications of {MRI} to the cerebral vasculature and diseases. The focus of this review is on obtaining an understanding through the application of advanced {MRI} methodology of both normal and abnormal blood flow in the cerebrovascular arteries, capillaries and veins.

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop an automated method for performing quality control ({QC}) tests in magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) systems, investigate the effect of different definitions of {QC} parameters and its sensitivity with respect to variations in regions of interest ({ROI}) positioning, and validate the reliability of the automated method by comparison with results from manual evaluations. Materials and Methods: Magnetic Resonance imaging {MRI} used for acceptance and routine {QC} tests from five {MRI} systems were selected. All {QC} tests were performed using the American College of Radiology ({ACR}) {MRI} accreditation phantom. The only selection criterion was that in the same {QC} test, images from two identical sequential sequences should be available. The study was focused on four {QC} parameters: percent signal ghosting ({PSG}), percent image uniformity ({PIU}), signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}), and {SNR} uniformity ({SNRU}), whose values are calculated using the mean signal and the standard deviation of {ROIs} defined within the phantom image or in the background. The variability of manual {ROIs} placement was emulated by the software using random variables that follow appropriate normal distributions. Results: Twenty-one paired sequences were employed. The automated test results for {PIU} were in good agreement with manual results. However, the {PSG} values were found to vary depending on the selection of {ROIs} with respect to the phantom. The values of {SNR} and {SNRU} also vary significantly, depending on the combination of the two out of the four standard rectangular {ROIs}. Furthermore, the methodology used for {SNR} and {SNRU} calculation also had significant effect on the results. Conclusions: The automated method standardizes the position of {ROIs} with respect to the {ACR} phantom image and allows for reproducible {QC} results.},

	abstract = {Image characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, {SNR}) may change over the course of a study. To monitor these changes a quality assurance ({QA}) protocol is necessary. {QA} can be realized both by performing regular phantom measurements and by controlling the human {MRI} datasets (e.g. noise detection in structural or movement parameters in functional datasets). Several {QA} tools for the assessment of {MRI} data quality have been developed. Many of them are freely available. This allows in principle the flexible set-up of a {QA} protocol specifically adapted to the aims of one’s own study. However, setup and maintenance of these tools bind time, in particular since the installation and operation often require a fair amount of technical knowledge. In this article we present a light-weighted virtual machine, named {LAB}-{QA}2GO, which provides scripts for fully automated {QA} analyses of phantom and human datasets. This virtual machine is ready for analysis by starting it the first time. With minimal configuration in the guided web-interface the first analysis can start within 10 minutes, while adapting to local phantoms and needs is easily possible. The usability and scope of {LAB}–{QA}2GO is illustrated using a data set from the {QA} protocol of our lab. With {LAB}–{QA}2GO we hope to provide an easy-to-use toolbox that is able to calculate {QA} statistics without high effort.},

	abstract = {Routine quality assurance ({QA}) is necessary and essential to ensure {MR} scanner performance. This includes geometric distortion, slice positioning and thickness accuracy, high contrast spatial resolution, intensity uniformity, ghosting artefact and low contrast object detectability. However, this manual process can be very time consuming. This paper describes the development and validation of an open source tool to automate the {MR} {QA} process, which aims to increase physicist efficiency, and improve the consistency of {QA} results by reducing human error. The {OSAQA} software was developed in Matlab and the source code is available for download from http://jidisun.wix.com/osaqa-project/. During program execution {QA} results are logged for immediate review and are also exported to a spreadsheet for long-term machine performance reporting. For the automatic contrast {QA} test, a user specific contrast evaluation was designed to improve accuracy for individuals on different display monitors. American College of Radiology {QA} images were acquired over a period of 2 months to compare manual {QA} and the results from the proposed {OSAQA} software. {OSAQA} was found to significantly reduce the {QA} time from approximately 45 to 2 min. Both the manual and {OSAQA} results were found to agree with regard to the recommended criteria and the differences were insignificant compared to the criteria. The intensity homogeneity filter is necessary to obtain an image with acceptable quality and at the same time keeps the high contrast spatial resolution within the recommended criterion. The {OSAQA} tool has been validated on scanners with different field strengths and manufacturers. A number of suggestions have been made to improve both the phantom design and {QA} protocol in the future.},
