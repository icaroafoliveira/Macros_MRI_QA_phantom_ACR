# Summary
MacroQA is a comprehensive ImageJ/Fiji [reference] macro designed to provide a more reliable and practical implementation of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Quality Assurance (QA) tests [reference]. Its development was driven by a commitment to serving academic and pedagogical purposes, specifically to facilitate and simplify the testing process for students and other users. By leveraging ImageJ and Fiji's embedded functions, MacroQA is able to perform all tests from the MRI ACR phantom manual with impressive accuracy and efficiency, completing the entire process in just a few minutes.
