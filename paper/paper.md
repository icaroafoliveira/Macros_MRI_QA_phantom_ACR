# Summary
MacroQA is a comprehensive ImageJ/Fiji [reference] macro designed to provide a more reliable and practical implementation of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Quality Assurance (QA) tests [reference]. Its development was driven by a commitment to serving academic and pedagogical purposes, specifically to facilitate and simplify the testing process for students and other users. By leveraging ImageJ and Fiji's embedded functions, MacroQA is able to perform all tests from the MRI ACR phantom manual with impressive accuracy and efficiency, completing the entire process in just a few minutes.

# Statement of need
Many existing implementations for performing ACR QA tests are based on proprietary software, such as MATLAB, which requires a paid license and limits accessibility. This creates a significant barrier for researchers, educators, and students in resource-constrained environments.

In contrast, MacroQA is built on a foundation of completely free and open-source software, ImageJ/Fiji, and utilizes an accessible scripting language (Jython). This design choice not only removes financial barriers but also promotes the core principles of academic research, including transparency and reproducibility. By making the code publicly available, the scientific community can readily inspect, verify, and build upon the macro, fostering collaborative development and ensuring the long-term utility of the tool. This open-source approach directly addresses the need for a cost-effective, easily shared, and verifiable solution for MRI phantom QA.
